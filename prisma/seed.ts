    title: "Building Character Through Education",
    content: `
      <h2>Education That Goes Beyond Academics</h2>
      <p>At Saint Charles K. LTD, we believe that true education encompasses more than just academic knowledge. It involves the development of character, values, and life skills that prepare students to be responsible and ethical members of society.</p>
      
      <h3>Character Development in Our Curriculum</h3>
      <p>Character education is woven throughout our curriculum and school culture. We emphasize values such as:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Being honest and ethical in all actions</li>
        <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Treating others with dignity and consideration</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Taking ownership of one's actions and commitments</li>
        <li><strong>Perseverance:</strong> Developing resilience in the face of challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understanding and sharing the feelings of others</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Learning Through Service</h3>
      <p>We believe that service to others is a powerful way to build character. Our students participate in community service projects that help them develop empathy, social responsibility, and leadership skills.</p>
